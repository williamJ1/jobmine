                        <p>This privacy policy (this "Policy") describes the practices of Jobmine Inc. and its corporate affiliates ("we", "us", "our") with respect to our collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information provided to us from users of (a) the website operated at jobmine and such other locations as made available from time to time (the "Website"), (b) any "app" or other front-end software provided by us (for greater certainty, excluding third party software that may interact with the Website or the Service, as defined below) that interacts or interfaces with the Website (the "Software"), and (c) the services we provide through the Website and/or the Software (collectively, the "Service"). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is incorporated by reference to the general Terms of Service for Jiffy located at, and forms an integral part of it. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning provided in the general Terms of Service for Jobmine.</p>

                        <h4>Introduction and General Concepts </h4>
                        <p>We respect and uphold individual rights to privacy and the protection of personal information. We know how important it is to protect your personal information and want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. We have appointed a Privacy Officer who is responsible for our compliance with this Policy. Information on how to contact the Privacy Officer can be found below.
                        </p>
                        <h5>a.Personal Information</h5>
                        <p>For the purposes of this Policy, "personal information" means information about an identifiable individual, including, for example, an individual's name, home address, telephone number, social insurance number, sex, income and family status. Personal information does not include information that would enable an individual to be contacted at a place of business, for example an employee's name, position or title, business telephone number, or business address. We will only collect, use or disclose personal information in accordance with this Policy, or in accordance with laws applicable to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by us ("Applicable Privacy Laws").
                        </p>
                        <h5>b.Non-Personal Information</h5>
                        <p>On the other hand, "non-personal information" is any type of information other than personal information, and is excluded from this Policy. For example, non-personal information would include business information, or information that enables an individual to be contacted at a place of business, for example an employee's name, position or title, business telephone number, or business address. Non-personal information also includes information that is anonymous or not about an identifiable information, such as web browsing information (such as the domain used to access the Website, or the type and version of device, browser or operating system being used to access the Service), or aggregate information that anonymizes the underlying data (like the number of visitors, what pages users visit, average time spent on the Website or on various parts of the Service). We will collect, use or disclose non-personal information in accordance with our ordinary business practices, but always in accordance with any applicable laws. This Policy, however, only covers our collection, use and disclosure of personal information.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Removal of Your Information</h4>
                        <p>We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and to meet any legal requirements. Personal information used to make a decision that directly affects an individual will be kept for at least one year after such a decision. We have retention standards that meet these parameters. We destroy your information when it is no longer needed or required to be kept, or we remove your personally identifiable information to render it anonymous.</p>
